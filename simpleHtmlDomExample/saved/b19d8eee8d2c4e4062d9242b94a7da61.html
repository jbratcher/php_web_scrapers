I don’t understand why though... California has so many issues and hazards... earthquakes, wild fires, large amounts of air pollution, expensive cost of living (taxes are some of the highest in US), water draughts, etc.

I personally have no desire to ever live in California. Anyone else out there share this viewpoint? 17.3k 7.0k comments share  save <p><p> 52.3k r/iamverybadass• Posted by u/maverick_300110 hours ago 2  2 JoinTrump destroyed                            View Comments Play 0:000:00Settings Fullscreen  52.3k 4.1k comments share  save <p><p><p><p> 14.1k r/quityourbullshit• Posted by u/Slavitt42 hours agoJoinLil Nas X shuts down AJC                             14.1k 355 comments share  save <p><p> 8.5k r/politics• Posted by u/talktalktalk_talk3 hours ago  Donald Trump is &#x27;incompetent&#x27;, Britain&#x27;s ambassador to Washington &#x27;says in leaked memos&#x27;                            telegraph.co.uk/politi...Join 8.5k 466 comments share  save <p><p> 57.1k r/JusticeServed• Posted by u/SubstantialHippo11 hours agoJoinConvicted pedophile YouTuber Austin Jones is now in prison serving a 10 year sentence as of 29/6/2019.Courtroom Justice                              57.1k 3.9k comments share  save <p><p> 61.0k r/worldnews• Posted by u/classsiob23b13 hours ago   4 A trillion new trees could be the best solution to climate change, study says                            thefirstnewspaper.com/intern...Join 61.0k 3.5k comments share  save <p><p> 52.6k r/Damnthatsinteresting• Posted by u/mossberg9115 hours ago  JoinBackseat Comfort of a Rolls RoyceVideo                              52.6k 3.3k comments share  save <p>
